# Activity 3 - Python Exercise Conditionals, Loops, Functions, and Value Errors

## Objectives
* Demonstrate your ability to create a python program that will ask for a number of points and provide a Letter grade for this class based on the Grade scale provided in the syllabus.
* You will need to demonstrate your knowledge of:
  1. Initializing variables and assigning data
  2. Syntax for Print and Input functions
  3. Boolean expressions
  4. Selection structure - If, Elif and Else
  5. Repetition structure (while loop)
  6. Using functions
  7. Defining functions
  8. Recovering from invalid numeric user input errors
  9. Simple comments including the following REQUIRED program file header at the top of the Python file:
    a. Your name
    b. The course name and date
    c. A short description of the code in the file (i.e. purpose of the program)
  10. Debugging errors found in a simple python program.

## Directions
Create a python file called Activity3.py that calculates the Letter grade for a class in a nearby university assuming a scale of 1000 points for the class and uses the following grading scale.
There is an activity3.py program file. Erase the current code in the file and create the code to complete the requirements as stated in the [activity3](https://github.com/uno-isqa-3900/activity3/blob/master/Activity%203.pdf) on Canvas.

## Submitting your assignment
1. Before the due date/time, when you are happy with your working code push the code to GitHub and be sure your GitHub repository is updated. This file should be in the repository shared by the instructor for this class.
2. Create a markdown file/document and make one or more screenshots of the code working in the command line (run several different grades through the program and add it to the markdown file/document labeled 3900_Activity3.
